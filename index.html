                I've been enrolled as a student at Bellevue College since January 2022, pursuing studies in Software Development. Programming has become a passion of mine, and I believe I have the potential to thrive in this field.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of academics, I'm a devoted mother to a wonderful 14-year-old daughter. As she navigates through the challenges of adolescence, I'm there to support and guide her every step of the way.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my roles as a student and a mother, I also work part-time as an organizational process manager at a small moving company. It's a role that allows me to apply my skills in streamlining operations and enhancing efficiency.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond work and studies, my daughter and I find fulfillment in volunteering at the Russian Orthodox Church. Together, we help prepare and serve lunches for fellow parishioners, contributing to our community in a meaningful way.
            </p>

                Completing our family is our beloved Maltipoo dog named Roni, who brings joy and companionship to our lives every day.
